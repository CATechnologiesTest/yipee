## Getting Started

### Development server

Begin by installing the required dependencies.
1. Install npm by navigating to the UI directory of the yipee repo on your computer and typing `npm install` in the terminal. (this will install npm in the directory)
2. Globally download the Angular CLI by typing in the same terminal `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. After both have been installed, you can run a development server by typing in the same terminal `npm run start`. (this starts a development server where the browser will automatically reload if you change any of the UI source files)
4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. To build a production version of Yipee, run `npm run build-prod` which will clean, build, run tests, and build a production version of the product.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Get code coverage

Run `npm run coverage` to get code coverage statistics in the coverage directory.
